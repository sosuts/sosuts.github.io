Iâ€™m a scientist at Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., specializing in the development and enhancement of diagnostic devices. Since I joined the company after completing my graduate studies in 2021, I have been actively involved in implementing image analysis programs, improving user interfaces, and automating data analysis and visualization.

My initial work was in biological research using *Drosophila melanogaster*. My graduate studies led me to explore programming with Python and Julia. Currently, I am interested in backend development and data analysis.

My goal is to advance healthcare and research through technological innovation while continuously developing my own skills and pursuing personal growth.
