I work for a company in the healthcare sector, primarily involved in developing image analysis software, as well as working on in-house data analysis and automation projects. My role is to leverage software to improve the efficiency of research and development.

During my university years, I majored in biology. However, instead of focusing on data-driven "dry" biology, like bioinformatics, I studied "wet" biology, which is more experimental in nature. My research topics included the development of *Drosophila melanogaster* and the dynamics of protein membranes. It was during my master’s program that I started learning programming and data analysis. At the time, I wasn’t particularly interested in programming itself, but I felt the need for automation after hitting the limits of manual work with Excel. As I delved deeper into data analysis, I gradually developed an interest in software engineering, and I’ve continued to study it as a personal interest.

Before joining a company, I had to withdraw from my doctoral program after earning the necessary credits but without obtaining the degree. For various reasons, I had thought that maybe I didn’t need a Ph.D., but something continued to weigh on my mind. So, from 2023 to 2024, I decided to revisit my research and experiments. Thanks to that effort, I was able to earn a Ph.D. in Science in March 2024, and I feel like I’ve finally achieved one of my goals. I’m deeply grateful to the professors from my research lab, my collaborators, my senior colleagues, and, of course, my wife, who supported me throughout.

The reason I started this blog is that I felt it would be good to have a personal platform to share information. I’ve been helped many times by blog posts and tweets from anonymous sources, so I’d be happy if I could be of help to someone as well. Of course, I also want to use this space to record my own learning journey. I’ll be taking it easy, but I’m looking forward to it!
